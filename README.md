### `GuessRandomInteger`
The application generates a random number between 1 and 100. Then, in a cycle, the operator is asked to enter a value. If he guessed the number, the number of attempts is displayed and the application stops. If he did not guess it, the applicatiaon displays whether the secret number is higher or lower than the one entered by the operator and the cycle resumes.
